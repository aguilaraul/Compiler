Tasks:

- Now that I have each token stored into the ArrayList, I want to work on just writing them to an XML file.
For now, I'm gonna work on writing to a (XML) file. Then I will figure out how to decide what each token
is before writing it to the file

TODO:
- After storing every token, take each token<String> and decide which type it is (keyword, symbol, etc.)
using whileHasMoreTokens
    - Write XML file with information


Completed
* Read each line then strip away single line comment, multi-line comments, and API comments

* Parse each String in splitTokens[] into the ArrayList
    * if String.isEmpty, tokens.add("");
    * if String.length == 1, add splitToken
    - if String.length > 1
        - check each char in the String if it's a symbol
            - if the current char is a symbol
                - save the index of the symbol
            - if the current char is not a symbol
                - move to next char
        - if no symbols are found
            - add splitToken

Abandoned:
? Before splitting each line, check if it has a String (look for "") because I need to keep
    that String together before splitting up the whole line

* split(" ") into different parts and store them in splitTokens[]
