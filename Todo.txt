TODO:

* Read each line then strip away single line comment, multi-line comments, and API comments

Tasks:
? After cleaning, split(" ") into different parts and store them in parseTokens[]
    - if parseTokens[] == 1, add to tokens<String>
    - otherwise, take item in parseTokens[] and convert to char array to read through
    to find a symbol
        - if a symbol is found, split item into (before_symbol | symbol | after_symbol)
        and add (before_symbol | symbol) to tokens<String>; (after_symbol) becomes the new toCharArray()
        - Repeat for all items in the current parseTokens[]
    - Read the next line

- After storing every token, take each token<String> and decide which type it is (keyword, symbol, etc.)
